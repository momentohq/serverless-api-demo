# Serverless Typescript API With Momento

This tutorial shows a basic serverless typescript REST api using DynamoDB supercharged with [Momento](https://www.gomomento.com/). It contains a 
Serverless Application that can be built and deployed with [SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) cli. The API is supposed to represent a basic `users` 
api. It contains the following endpoints:

```text
# Generate base users in DDB to use for test 
POST /bootstrap-users

# Get single user
GET /users?id=1
GET /cached-users?id=1

# Get passed users followers names
GET /followers?id=1
GET /cached-followers?id=1
```

#### POST /bootstrap-users
Bootstraps all the test user data needed. For this demo it generates
100 test users each following 50-60 random other test users.

#### GET /users & /cached-users
Makes 1 call to DynamoDB (`/users`) or Momento (`/cached-users`)
```text
$ curl https://x949ucadkh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/cached-users\?id\=2 -s | jq .
{
  "id": "2",
  "followers": [ "36", "4", "21", "21", "69", "69", "60", "48", "20", "35", "57", "51", "37", "75", "61", "48", "69", "28", "60", "30", "41", "79", "75", "46", "21", "51", "37", "52", "76", "62", "11", "38", "98", "10", "15", "90", "5", "97", "70", "44", "88", "31", "76", "97", "48", "15", "85", "64", "93", "5"],
  "name": "Happy Wombat"
}
```
In case you don't have it already, [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a great tool for working with JSON.

#### GET /followers & /cached-followers
Will make 1 call to either DynamoDB (`/followers`) or Momento (`/cached-followers`) for the passed
user id and then N additional calls to either DynamoDB or Momento to look up each follower name.
```text
$ curl https://x949ucadkh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/cached-followers\?id\=1 -s

```
When deployed you will have an application that looks like this in your account:

The lambda application will produce these CloudWatch metrics for you to explore and contrast:
|Momento|DynamoDB|
|------|-----|
|momento-get|ddb-get|
|get-cached-followers|get-followers|

## Pre-reqs
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
* [Local AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
* [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
  * _Note: Make sure you are on latest version_

## Tutorial
1. Please clone this repo.
    1. `git clone git@github.com:momentohq/serverless-api-demo.git`
2. Change working directory to the repo you just cloned
    1. `cd serverless-api-demo`
3. Make sure you have your local AWS credentials configured. Please see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) for more info on getting started.
4. Install Momento CLI
   1. `brew tap momentohq/tap` 
   2. `brew install momento-cli`
5. Obtain a momento auth token in us-east-1
   1. `momento account signup aws --region us-east-1 --email my-email@demo.com`
6. Update your Momento Auth token for `us-east-1` in [app.ts](https://github.com/momentohq/serverless-api-demo/blob/main/src/app.ts#L10) update `REPLACE_ME`.
7. Create a cache for demo with momento cli
   1. `momento configure --quick`
   2. `momento cache create --name momento-demo-users`
8. Build the project
    1. `sam build --beta-features`
9. Deploy the project into your AWS account
    1. `sam deploy --resolve-s3`
10. Get the URL of your new API from cfn output shown after `sam deploy` and set in env variable.
    1. ex: `export API_URL=https://x949ucadkh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod`
       1. _Make sure to replace with your demo stack value `x949ucadkh` is just an example._
11. Bootstrap test users
    1. `curl -X POST "$API_URL/bootstrap-users"`
12. Start benchmark script
     1. `cd bench && ./start.sh`
13. Navigate to locust dashboard at http://0.0.0.0:8089/
    1. Start synthetic test with `20` users and spawn rate of `5`
    2. Make sure to enter host you got from output of `sam deploy`
14. Open AWS Cloudwatch Metrics service in your aws account and Look for [aws-embeded-metrics](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#metricsV2:graph=~();namespace=~'aws-embedded-metrics) under the 'custom' metric namespace
    1. _Be patient if metrics don't show up right away. It can take a few minutes at first._
15. Chart custom metrics to compare response times.
